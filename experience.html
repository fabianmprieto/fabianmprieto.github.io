<h2>Relevant Experiences</h2>
<h4>Undergraduate Reasearcher - Thermally Reactive Materials</h4>
<h5>Auburn University</h5>
<h5>May - July 2024</h5>
<ul>
    <li>In this role I was a Undergraduate student researcher contributing to the research and development of thermally reactive materials, mostly composites, to be utilized in space deployment scenarios such as satelite deployment.</li>
    <li>I was tasked with contributing to the design of a system to recreate the manufacturing process of certain materials with the properties needed to be thermally reactive in order to determine whether this process plays a part why the materials are thermally reactive.</li>
    <li>The specifics of what I did was collaborating with fellow student researchers as well as out professor to design the system, after which I created 3D models of system parts which I then turned into engineering drawings to then pass along to machinist to create, after which I began assembling parts of prototype system.</li>
    <li>Some of the skills gained from this experience were 3D CAD modeling using Solidworks, GD&T at a basic level, prototype creation, and 2D engineering drawings.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cryogenic Fuel Tank Analysis</h4>
<h5>Oct - Dec 2023</h5>
<ul>
    <li>A group project during which my team researched and designed a conceptual cryogenic fuel tank with my main task being to create models and conduct heat transfer analysis.</li>
    <li>The main focus of our design was to determine whether it was capable of withstanding the loads that we determined and also maintain the temperature necessary for the fuel.</li>
    <li>After extensive research into similar systems, materials, and structural designs we tested various design configurations utilizing an FEA excel sheet created by our team in order to verify the tank design.</li>
    <li>Once the design was established 3D models were rendered in both Solidworks and Patran (FEA analysis software) which were then used to run FEA analysis and heat transfer analysis on both the tank and the supporting structures.</li>
    <li>The results of the preliminary analysis and the later analysis were compared in order to back up our initial results and then collected into various technical reports over the course of the project with our findings then being presented to our class and instructor.</li>

<h4>Structural Dynamics Analysis</h4>
<h5>Jan - May 2024</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Individual project in which I was tasked with conducting Structural dynamics analysis on various systems utilizing Python-based scripts that were run on Alabama Super Computer Cluster (ASC).</li>
    <li>Scripts were created utilizing FEnics, a finite element package, where scripts contained the data related to analysis of the systems such as geometry and meshing, and the static and dynamic analysis of the system.</li>
    <li>The scripts were then imported into the ASC, and depending on the depth of the analysis, it would be sometime between runs after which the results were viewed in a visualization software, VisIT.</li>
    <li>The various systems were analyzed under different loads, durations, meshing, and even scenario testing, and the results were collected into technical reports to be submitted.</li>

<h4>Conceptual Aircraft Wing Analysis</h4>
<h5>May - July 2024</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Individual project in which I was tasked with designing and analyzing the conceptual wing of a theoretical aircraft created by an AI based on a prompt I provided.</li>
    <li>The AI software was used to establish theoretical dimensions and material properties, which would be utilized in the later analysis. The finalized design of the aircraft was determined after discussions with the AI to ensure somewhat realistic parameters based on the initial prompt, and a graphic of the design was created with another AI software.</li>
    <li>After this, the FEA analysis was conducted on the wing of the aircraft using a MATLAB toolchain I developed for the initial wing configuration of stringers, skin thicknesses, etc.</li>
    <li>Following the preliminary analysis with MATLAB, another analysis was performed in Patran (FEA Software), where a full 3D model of the wing was created and analyzed under various determined loads that the wing would encounter.</li>
    <li>The results of both the preliminary and Patran analyses were compared and used to establish margins of safety and areas for improvement. The entire analysis process was documented in multiple technical reports and eventually presented to both the instructor and the class.</li>

<h4>Lunar Prospecting Rover Design Project</h4>
<h5>Sep 2023 - May 2024</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Group Senior Design Project:</strong> We designed a conceptual lunar prospecting rover capable of exploring and surviving at the lunar south pole for a year-long mission, based on the NASA RASCAL 2024 competition prompt.</li> 
    <li><strong>Subsystem Collaboration:</strong> The group was divided into two subsystems, and I participated in the design and co-leadership of the rover's power generation system, focusing specifically on the mechanical aspects.</li>
    <li><strong>Oversight of Mechanical System:</strong> I oversaw the research and design of the mechanical system, which included dimensions, materials, deployment methods, movement, solar panel articulation, 3D modeling/testing, and prototype design and construction. Additionally, I ensured that deadlines were met and team members were keyed into the needs of the mission and staying tuned into the progress of other groups within the team to ensure compatibility while brainstorming ideas for our design.</li> 
    <li><strong>Project Structure and Feedback:</strong> The project was structured to allow us to research and design our system at our own pace, while continuously improving our design based on feedback from experienced aerospace engineers with relevant knowledge in space missions based on our technical reports and presentations.</li> 
    <li><strong>Final Deliverables:</strong> By the end of the project, we submitted various technical reports and delivered a Senior Design Capstone Presentation. Our design had progressed to the analysis of structural designs and the creation of a prototype for one of the main components: the solar tracking system. We also began exploring the manufacturing processes and cost implications of the system.</li>
